# Quadric Fit
C++ library for handling quadrics - evaluation/gradient, approximate Euclidean distance computation, fitting on a triangle mesh, and classification.

There is also a test program for fitting and classification.

## Compilation
Uses [my geometry library](https://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom/). Needs [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) to compile.
Edit the `Makefile` to set the correct paths and build. The test program also needs [my Marching Cubes library](https://github.com/salvipeter/marching/).

## Documentation
Read the header file (`quadric-fit.hh`).
